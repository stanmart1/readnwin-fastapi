# Flutterwave Payment Cancellation Handling

## ✅ **Changes Made to Handle Cancelled Payments**

### **1. Payment Verification Logic (payment.py)**
```python
elif verification.verification_data.get("status") == "cancelled":
    payment.status = PaymentStatus.FAILED
    # Do NOT clear cart for cancelled payments - items remain for retry
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Cancelled payments marked as FAILED
- ✅ Cart items **NOT cleared** for cancelled payments
- ✅ User can retry payment with same items

### **2. Flutterwave Redirect URL (checkout_unified.py)**
```python
"redirect_url": f"{base_url}/payment/verify",
```

**Updated Flow:**
- ✅ Flutterwave redirects to `/payment/verify` page
- ✅ Verification page handles success/failure/cancellation

### **3. Payment Verification Page (payment/verify/page.tsx)**
```javascript
// Handle cancelled payments
if (status === 'cancelled') {
  router.push(`/payment/cancelled?order=${txRef}`);
  return;
}
```

**Cancellation Flow:**
- ✅ Detects cancelled status from URL params
- ✅ Redirects to payment cancelled page
- ✅ Preserves order reference for context

### **4. Payment Cancelled Page (payment/cancelled/page.tsx)**
```javascript
// Updated messaging
"Your cart items remain saved for retry"
```

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Clear explanation of what happened
- ✅ Reassurance that no charges were made
- ✅ Confirmation that cart items are preserved
- ✅ Easy retry and navigation options

## **Complete Payment Flow for Cancellations:**

### **User Journey:**
1. **Checkout** → Items in cart, order created
2. **Flutterwave Payment** → User cancels payment
3. **Redirect to Verify** → Detects cancellation status
4. **Cancelled Page** → Shows cancellation message
5. **Cart Preserved** → Items remain for retry
6. **Retry Option** → User can try payment again

### **Technical Implementation:**

#### **Backend Changes:**
- ✅ Payment verification handles cancelled status
- ✅ Cart clearing only for successful payments
- ✅ Failed/cancelled payments preserve cart

#### **Frontend Changes:**
- ✅ Payment verification page detects cancellation
- ✅ Automatic redirect to cancellation page
- ✅ Clear messaging about preserved cart
- ✅ Easy retry navigation

### **Key Benefits:**

✅ **No Lost Items** - Cart preserved for cancelled payments
✅ **Clear Communication** - User knows exactly what happened
✅ **Easy Recovery** - Simple retry process
✅ **No Charges** - Confirmation that no money was taken
✅ **Seamless UX** - Smooth flow from cancellation to retry

### **Status Handling Matrix:**

| Payment Status | Cart Action | Library Action | User Redirect |
|---------------|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Successful** | Clear cart | Add ebooks | Success page |
| **Failed** | Keep cart | No action | Failed page |
| **Cancelled** | Keep cart | No action | Cancelled page |
| **Pending** | Keep cart | No action | Pending page |

The system now properly handles Flutterwave payment cancellations while preserving the user's cart for easy retry.
