# eBook Library Integration Summary

## ✅ **Verification Complete: eBooks Automatically Added to User Library**

### **Payment Method Based Flow:**

#### **Flutterwave Payments:**
- ✅ **Cart cleared immediately** after successful payment verification
- ✅ **eBooks added to library immediately** after payment verification
- ✅ User can start reading right away

#### **Bank Transfer Payments:**
- ✅ **Cart remains until admin approval** 
- ✅ **eBooks added to library only after admin confirms payment**
- ✅ Cart cleared when admin approves payment

### **Code Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Payment Verification (payment.py)**
```python
# For Flutterwave payments: Auto-add eBooks to library and clear cart
ebook_items = db.query(OrderItem).join(Book).filter(
    OrderItem.order_id == payment.order_id,
    Book.format.in_(["ebook", "both"])
).all()

# Clear user's cart after successful Flutterwave payment
db.query(Cart).filter(Cart.user_id == current_user.id).delete()
```

#### 2. **Admin Payment Approval (payment.py)**
```python
# Add eBooks to user library for approved bank transfer payments
# Clear user's cart (already exists)
```

#### 3. **Checkout Process (checkout_unified.py)**
- Removed automatic cart clearing from checkout
- Cart clearing now handled based on payment method and status

### **Updated User Messages:**

#### **Cart Page:**
- ✅ "Books will be added to your library for reading after payment"
- ✅ "eBooks will be added to your library for reading"

### **Database Integration:**

#### **UserLibrary Table:**
```sql
user_library (
  user_id -> users.id,

  status: 'unread' (default)
)
```

#### **Book Formats Supported:**
- ✅ `format = 'ebook'` - Digital only
